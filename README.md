# Node.js-Learning

My personal Node.js learning repository - covering fundamentals to advanced concepts.

## Global object:
- For node, global object is known as "global", just like window in browser.
- logging "this" in node will be empty object.
- based on the community's decision there is one more property called "globalThis" is also the global object, which exist in every js engine.

## Module:
- whenever we create a separate module and import it using require() function, that module run (add console.log() statement to check), but its variables and functions are private to other modules. we cannot access it normally. we need to export properties to use those in other modules.
- we can import properties using object or desdestructuring. for destructuring, we must maintain the properties same name.
- we can use 2 kind of modules:
    - **CommonJS module (CJS)**: it was the original system for Node.js. for import/export we use require() function and module.exports. it is synchronous(blocking). requires bundling or transpiling (transpiling is the process of converting source code from one version of JavaScript (e.g., modern ES6+) into another version (e.g., older ES5) that can run in environments with limited or outdated support for the newer features). not natively supported. works in non-strict mode
    - **ES module (ESM, MJS)**: it is the modern, standardized system for both browsers and Node.js. we can use import and export keyword. asynchronous (non-blocking). native support in all modern browsers.<br>To use ES module we need to add extension in package.json. works in strict mode.
